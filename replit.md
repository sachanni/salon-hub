## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design System**: Custom professional purple/rose gradient scheme with Inter and Source Sans Pro typography, light theme, pastel gradients, and soft animated elements.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first adaptive layouts.
- **Key UI Elements**: Fresha-inspired date/time pickers, compact calendars, and professional dashboards.
- **Salon Profile**: Fresha.com/Luzo.app inspired profile with hero image gallery, sticky navigation (top-0), Fresha-style sticky booking sidebar with production-ready sticky implementation:
  - **Sticky Positioning (Oct 2025)**: Grid-based layout with `lg:sticky lg:top-[88px]` provides precise 88px offset for sticky behavior below navigation bar on large screens
  - **Height Management**: `lg:max-h-[calc(100vh-120px)]` with `lg:overflow-y-auto` ensures sidebar content scrolls when exceeds viewport height, matches sticky offset
  - Displays salon name, rating with stars, intelligent day-based open/closed status with 60-second updates that checks businessHours for current day
  - Book now button, contact info, address with Google Maps directions integration
  - Google-style business hours display
- **Search Bar & Map Layout**: Consistent positioning for search dropdowns and Fresha-inspired map proportions with a compact sidebar.
- **Image Carousel**: Interactive image carousel on salon cards.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS, and Vite.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, RESTful API design, Drizzle ORM.

- **Time Slot Management**: Timezone-safe handling, dynamic generation based on salon hours (30-minute intervals), and robust date parsing/formatting.
- **Real-Time Booking Availability**: Production-ready slot conflict detection with 15-second polling, comprehensive overlap prevention, and staff-aware availability.
- **Multi-Day Booking**: Supports any future date, dynamically generates slots from `businessHours` JSONB, checks existing bookings, and displays color-coded slots.
- **Interactive Calendar Component**: Professional month view with quick-selects, month navigation, past-date prevention, and timezone-safe date normalization.
- **Mapbox Maps Integration**: Fresha-style minimalist map using Mapbox GL JS and react-map-gl for salon location display, featuring numbered markers, interactive popups, user location tracking, clustering, "Search This Area" functionality, and turn-by-turn directions via Mapbox Directions API.
